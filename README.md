Hails!

I am Dallas. I am a 39 year old father of 3 and grandfather of 1 adorable little girl! I currently reside in SE TN, but am moving to Maine in the next few weeks. 

I am a forever learner. I make sure to learn something new everyday. 

I am currently attending WGU for my bachelors in Cybersecurity and Information Assurance. I plan to graduate during the summer of 2026 and then immediately get my Masters and possibly PhD.

In my time as a DevSecOps Engineer and IT Security Analyst/Purple Teamer/Cloud Security Architect/Engineer I have achieved the following milestones:

I obtained the following certifications:
- CompTIA A+ (1101, waiting to take 1102) - Jan 2024
- ISC2 Certified In Cybersecurity - Oct 2023
- CompTIA Security Plus - Oct 2023

 Through my degree program I will get the following certifications, plus a few more!

## This is my projected certification testing plan. 

- CompTIA A+ 1102 (part 2) - Feb 2024
- CompTIA Network+ - March 2024
- Linux+ - March 2024
- CompTIA Project+ - April 2024
- Certified Ethical Hacker - May 2024
- Azure AZ-500 - June 2024
- Azure AZ-900 - July 2024
- CompTIA CySA+ - August 2024

- Linux Essentials - Feb 2026
- Certified Cloud Security Professional (CCSP) – April 2026
- Systems Security Certified Practitioner (SSCP) – June 2026


I haven't planned much farther than that at this moment. 

## My career/professional path: 

I am looking for CISO or similar roles, Sr. Security Analyst, Sr. Cloud Engineer/Architect, Jr./Sr. Penetration Tester, Blue/Purple teaming, DFIR, Sales, account executive, content creation, leadership roles, or teaching roles.

I'm really open to anything and I am more than qualified for any role that may be offered. With my hobbyist passion for psychology and social engineering, I am very comfortable in intense technical interviews and working under pressue. 

I've have been offered two jobs in the past year, making more than I currently make, and turned them both down. I am very happy where I am, but I feel I am ready for my next step! 

I'm ready to not just break the 6 figure barrier floor, but to leap above it. 
I am only entertaining roles that will compensate at least $150k/annual with stock options, unlimited PTO, 401k matching (percentage not important), and great employer paid health benefits. I would like perks as well, vision, dental, AD&D, voluntary life, pet insurance, homeowner insurance, etc.
